# Docs

Welcome to the documentation!  

These pages are not just a technical reference — they’re meant to explain **why** I built this project the way I did, and to give you the mental model behind each design choice. My goal is to make the docs a mix of *how-to guides* and *the reasoning behind them*, so that you don’t just know **what** to do, but also **why** it works that way.

Think of this as a logbook of experiments, ideas, and tools I’ve refined. If you’re working in neuroscience, hardware control, or closed-loop experiments, you’ll hopefully find practical examples you can reuse — and also insight into how to adapt them to your own setup.

The [API](../api/index.md) section is available separately if you want to dive into specific functions and reference material.

 *Why write these docs?*  
Because building experimental setups can feel like reinventing the wheel every time. By sharing both the workflow and the reasoning, I want to lower the friction for anyone tackling similar challenges, and also document the thought process for myself as I refine the tools further.
