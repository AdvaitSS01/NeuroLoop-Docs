# Welcome to NeuroLoop Docs

This site documents my work on building advanced closed-loop neuroscience experiments using **Bonsai**, **NI DAQ**, and **Arduinos**.  

Here you will find articles on:  

- High-frequency triggers across devices  
- Multi-Arduino serial communication  
- Real-time closed-loop logic  
- Eye-state detection and response control  
- Troubleshooting, optimization, and lessons learned
